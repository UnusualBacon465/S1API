# A Schedule One Mono / Il2Cpp Cross Compatibility Layer
S1API is an open source collaboration project to help standardize Schedule One modding processes.
The goal is to provide a standard place for common functionalities so you can focus on making content versus reverse engineering the game.

## Do I need this?
If you're using or plan to use any mods that depend on S1API, then yes. 

## How do I use this to make mods?
Go check out the extremely helpful resources on our [GitHub](https://github.com/KaBooMa/S1API).

## I'm getting errors from S1API, what do I do?
Please head over to the [GitHub](https://github.com/KaBooMa/S1API) page and create a new issue for us.
You can also post in the modding Discord under our thread 😀.
